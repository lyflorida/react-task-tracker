This is a simple task tracker created using the React JavaScript framework. You are able to create a task, assign a due date and time, and determine if you'd like to set a reminder for the task.
Clicking the add button toggles the UI for creating a task, and clicking the subsequent delete button minimizes the UI out of view.
